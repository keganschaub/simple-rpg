This was my final project for CSC 335: Object Oriented Programming and Design in Fall 2013. The course emulated an Agile programming environment, with pair-programming emphasized on all projects. This final project was done in collaboration with Zach Van Uum and Kegan Schaub. All music was written and recorded by me, all graphics done by Kegan Schaub, and all code evenly contribued to by the three of us. Version control through BitBucket was used during the semester, so only the final version exists here.
